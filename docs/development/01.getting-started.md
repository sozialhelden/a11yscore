# Getting started

In order to run a11yscore locally, you need to have the following requirements installed on your system:

* [bun](https://bun.sh/) v1.2 or greater
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) or an alternative container runtime that supports compose files

## Set up the project

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sozialhelden/a11yscore.git
cd a11yscore
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
bun install
```

**3. Create `.env` file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**4. Start the database**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**5. Run migrations**

Wait a few moments until the database is fully up and running, then run the migrations:
```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

**6. Start the development server**
```bash
bun run dev
```

Now you can open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.

## Useful commands

```bash
# check the code for formatting errors
bun run format

# format the code
bun run format:fix

# lint the code
