## Technologies used

The a11y-Score project imports a [Planet OSM file](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) using [imposm3](https://imposm.org/docs/imposm3/latest/) into a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database with the [PostGIS extension](https://postgis.net/).

Configuration and code is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), which runs primarily SQL queries against the PostgreSQL database (OSM Sync) to compute scores and persist them in a second PostgreSQL database (App). The backend itself is built on top of [nitro](https://nitro.build/). [drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) is used as abstraction layer on top of the database and for managing the schema and running migrations on the results database. [Redis](https://redis.io/) is being used as message queue and key value storage, and we use [bullmq](https://docs.bullmq.io/) as a task runner and scheduler.

The [frontend](https://github.com/sozialhelden/a11yscore-frontend) is built with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) and uses Sozialheldens own [ui library](https://github.com/socialhelden/ui). For internationalization, we use [Transifex Native](https://transifex.com) across all of our projects.
